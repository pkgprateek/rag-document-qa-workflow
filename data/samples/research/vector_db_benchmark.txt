Vector Database Performance at Scale: Benchmarking ChromaDB, Pinecone, and Weaviate

Abstract
Vector databases have become critical infrastructure for semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation. This benchmark study evaluates three leading vector databases—ChromaDB, Pinecone, and Weaviate—across dimensions of query latency, indexing throughput, storage efficiency, and scalability. We test performance with datasets ranging from 100K to 100M vectors (768 dimensions) using realistic workloads. Results show that Pinecone achieves lowest P99 latency (12ms) at scale, Weaviate offers best indexing throughput (45K vectors/sec), and ChromaDB provides superior cost-efficiency for small-to-medium datasets (<10M vectors). We identify when to select each database based on workload characteristics and provide optimization recommendations.

1. Introduction
Vector similarity search underpins modern AI applications. Selecting the right vector database requires understanding performance tradeoffs. This study provides quantitative comparison under controlled conditions.

2. Methodology
Datasets: SBERT embeddings (768-dim) from Wikipedia, arXiv, and web crawl
Workloads: (1) Bulk indexing, (2) Real-time insertions, (3) Similarity search (k=10), (4) Filtered search, (5) Hybrid search
Infrastructure: AWS c5.4xlarge instances, 16 vCPU, 32GB RAM
Metrics: Query latency (P50, P95, P99), indexing throughput, storage size, memory usage

3. Results
3.1 Query Latency (1M vectors, k=10)
- ChromaDB: P50=8ms, P99=42ms
- Pinecone: P50=5ms, P99=12ms
- Weaviate: P50=7ms, P99=28ms

3.2 Indexing Throughput
- ChromaDB: 12K vectors/sec
- Pinecone: 18K vectors/sec (managed service)
- Weaviate: 45K vectors/sec (batch mode)

3.3 Scalability (100M vectors)
- ChromaDB: Not tested (optimized for <10M)
- Pinecone: P99=18ms, linear scaling
- Weaviate: P99=35ms, sublinear scaling

4. Recommendations
- ChromaDB: Prototyping, small-to-medium datasets, cost-sensitive deployments
- Pinecone: Production systems requiring low latency, managed infrastructure preferred
- Weaviate: High-throughput ingestion, complex filtering requirements, self-hosted infrastructure

5. Conclusion
No single "best" vector database exists. Selection depends on scale, latency requirements, budget, and operational preferences. Future work: multi-modal embeddings, approximate vs exact search tradeoffs.
